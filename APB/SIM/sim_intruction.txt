//step to follow specially when you are new to this (strictly follow this)
1) Complete the architecture code (skeleton)
2) Implement the driver logic
3) Implement the monitor logic
4) Implemnet other component i.e. ref_model, scoreboard, coverage collector etc.
Important note: After every stpe make sure compilation and simualtion is 
                error free. 
				And each component is working properly (not applicable for first step)
